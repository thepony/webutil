# webutil
Java Web Utility tool for http/https/POST/GET/base64/SQL testing

I use this tool on and off again for testing PHP pages, HTML, and other misc webserver pages when playing with different projects,
putting it up here to share with folks. You must keep the readme file with the source or compiled versions. You must have the JDBC
binaries in your build to use the SQL aspects of this source (otherwise it will fail!!).
